# What is Moody Pal?

Moody Pal is my attempt at creating productivity software for ADHD people in mind, or those who keep getting easily distracted.

Built with Avalonia

Added features so far:
- Localization, will use english but for testing it's latvian
- Splash screen with loading icon
- Mood selector which adapts the app 


TODO list:
- Notes

# Heavily WIP!
